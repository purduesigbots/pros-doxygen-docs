<para><simplesect kind="note"><para>For a full list of functions for interacting with Tasks, see its <ref refid="group__c-rtos" kindref="compound">C API</ref> and <ref refid="group__cpp-rtos" kindref="compound">C++ API</ref>. Task notifications are a powerful new feature in PROS 3 which allows direct-to-task synchronization. Each task has a 32-bit notification value. Each task can block on its own notification (wait for it to become non-zero) and any task can update the notification value. Task notifications have a broad range of applications, are simple to use, and have significant memory and speed advantages when compared to traditional semaphore-based synchronization mechanisms.</para>
