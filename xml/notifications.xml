<para><simplesect kind="note"><para>For a full list of functions for interacting with Tasks, see its <ulink url="../../api/c/rtos.html">C API</ulink> and <ulink url="../../api/cpp/rtos.html">C++ API</ulink>. Task notifications are a powerful new feature in PROS 3 which allows direct-to-task synchronization. Each task has a 32-bit notification value. Each task can block on its own notification (wait for it to become non-zero) and any task can update the notification value. Task notifications have a broad range of applications, are simple to use, and have significant memory and speed advantages when compared to traditional semaphore-based synchronization mechanisms.</para>
