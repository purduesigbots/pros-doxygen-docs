Each task has a 32-bit notification value. Each task can block on its own notification (wait for it to become non-zero) and any task can update the notification value. Task notifications have a broad range of applications, are simple to use, and have significant memory and speed advantages when compared to traditional semaphore-based synchronization mechanisms.</para><para>The simplest application of task notifications does not care about the task notification value: </para>    </detaileddescription>
