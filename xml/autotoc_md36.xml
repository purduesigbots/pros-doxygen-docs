<para>Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact with core components of PROS on your VEX V5 system.</para><para>The PROS tutorials are split into three sections:</para><para>If you&apos;re still new to writing software or PROS, and looking for additional information beyond our <ulink url="../getting-started/index.html">Getting Started</ulink> guides, the <bold>General Tutorials</bold> are a great resource for topics like debugging and the PROS project structure.</para><para>If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use PROS through practical applications, or teach students to use PROS in a classroom environment, the <bold>Walkthrough Tutorials</bold> are a great resource to go step by step through the process of writing a PROS program.</para><para>If you want more information about using a particular part of the <ulink url="../api/index.html">PROS API</ulink>, the <bold>Topical Tutorials</bold> offer longer examples and more detail about using the PROS API. </para>    </detaileddescription>
