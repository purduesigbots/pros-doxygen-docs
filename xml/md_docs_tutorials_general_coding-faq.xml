<listitem><para><computeroutput>&quot;main.h&quot; file not found</computeroutput>: : This error occurs when the compilation database <computeroutput>compile_commands.json</computeroutput> is not up to date. The file contains the exact compiler calls of the project, and should be automatically populated when the code is compiled. If you see this error just after creating a project, it could be because the project was created using the CLI without the <computeroutput>â€“compile-after</computeroutput> flag, or there was a hang-up in the editor after creating the project. Regardless of when this issue appears, running <computeroutput>pros make all</computeroutput> in the CLI or running <computeroutput>PROS -&gt; Build -&gt; All</computeroutput> in the editor, the whole project is compiled again, fixing this issue. You may need to close and reopen any files in order for the linter to catch up. It is also possible that a compilation error was not caught by the linter, so running a full build will help discover these hidden errors. </para></listitem></itemizedlist>

Due to the fact that PROS utilizes a priority based non-preemptive scheduler, tasks of higher or equal priority to the blocking task will still run while lower priority tasks will not. This scenario is also known as <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)">starvation</ulink>.

From the kernel&apos;s perspective, updating the LCD is usually less important than how well the robot is running, so PROS prioritizes user tasks over the LCD. <verbatim>The LCD is only updated if all other tasks are waiting.

<listitem><para><bold>Segmentation Fault:</bold> : Indicates that an invalid C pointer has been used. Check for confusion between pointers and regular variables and that an invalid pointer has not been passed to a PROS API function.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>Stack Overflow:</bold> : Often indicates infinite recursion, or that the stack size for a custom task is too small. Calling many layers of functions and declaring large local variables can require large amounts of space on the stack. If this error occurs in a default task like <computeroutput><ref refid="main_8h_1a2df3d06bc5bced154da27fce393f991f" kindref="member">autonomous()</ref></computeroutput>, consider changing code to reduce the stack requirements, or creating a new task with a larger stack size using <ulink url="../../api/c/rtos.html#task_create">task_create</ulink> to handle large jobs. Large arrays declared inside functions can usually be declared globally to alleviate pressure on stack space.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>System Task Failure:</bold> : Too many tasks were running for the system to start a new one.
