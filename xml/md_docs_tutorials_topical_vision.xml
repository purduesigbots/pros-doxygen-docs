<para><blockquote><para><bold>note</bold></para>
<para>For a full list of functions for interacting with the V5 Vision Sensor, see its : <ulink url="../../api/c/vision.html">C API</ulink> and <ulink url="../../api/cpp/vision.html">C++ API</ulink>. </para>
</blockquote></para>
<para><heading level="1">Setting Signatures</heading>
</para>
<para>The first step to using the vision sensor is setting color signatures for the sensor to recognize as objects. This is done through the V5 Vision Utility program.</para>
<para><heading level="1">Retrieving Objects</heading>
</para>
<para>The primary function of the vision sensor is returning objects, or blobs of color detected by the sensor. The characteristics of an object are defined in <ulink url="../../api/c/vision.html#vision_object_s_t">vision_object_s_t</ulink>.</para>
<para><heading level="2">By Size</heading>
</para>
<para>The simplest way to interact with the vision sensor is to get an object by its size. 0 is the largest object detected by the sensor.</para>
<para><heading level="2">By Signature</heading>
</para>
<para>If you have multiple signatures saved to the vision signature, you will most likely want to only look for objects of a particular signature. The <computeroutput>get_by_sig()</computeroutput> function implements this functionality.</para>
<para><heading level="1">Changing the Object Coordinates</heading>
</para>
<para>Each returned object from the vision sensor comes with a set of coordinates telling where the object was found in the vision sensor&apos;s field of view. The default behavior is to return the coordinates as a function of distance from the top left corner of the field of view - so positive y is downward and positive x is right. With the PROS API, you can change this behavior so that the center of the Field Of View is the (0,0) point for object coordinates. Positive y is still downward and positive x is still right, but negative y is upward of center and negative x is left of center in this configuration.</para>
<para><heading level="1">Exposure Setting</heading>
</para>
<para>In PROS Kernel 3.1.4 and earlier, the vision sensor exposure parameter was in the range [0,58]. In PROS Kernel 3.1.5 and newer, the parameter is scaled to be in the range [0,150] to match the Vision Sensor utility. As a result, there is a loss of information in this translation since multiple integers on the scale [0,150] map to the scale [0,58]. </para>
