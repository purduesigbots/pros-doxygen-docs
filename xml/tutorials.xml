<para>Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact with core components of PROS on your VEX V5 system.</para>
<para>The PROS tutorials are split into three sections:</para>
<sect2 id="tutorials_1autotoc_md31">
<title>General Tutorials</title>
<para>If you&apos;re still new to writing software or PROS, and looking for additional information beyond our <ref refid="getting-started" kindref="compound">Getting Started</ref> guides, the <bold>General Tutorials</bold> are a great resource for topics like debugging and the PROS project structure.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="tutorials_1autotoc_md32">
<title>Walkthrough Tutorials</title>
<para>If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use PROS through practical applications, or teach students to use PROS in a classroom environment, the <bold>Walkthrough Tutorials</bold> are a great resource to go step by step through the process of writing a PROS program.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="tutorials_1autotoc_md33">
<title>Topical Tutorials</title>
<para>If you want more information about using a particular part of the api, the <bold>Topical Tutorials</bold> offer longer examples and more detail about using the PROS API. </para>
