\page tutorials Tutorials

Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this
reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact
with core components of PROS on your VEX V5 system.

The PROS tutorials are split into three sections:

## General Tutorials

If you're still new to writing software or PROS, and looking for
additional information beyond our \ref getting-started guides, the **General
Tutorials** are a great resource for topics like debugging and the PROS
project structure.

- \subpage combining-c-cpp
- \subpage debugging
- \subpage project-structure
- \subpage troubleshooting

## Walkthrough Tutorials

If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use PROS through
practical applications, or teach students to use PROS in a classroom
environment, the **Walkthrough Tutorials** are a great resource to go
step by step through the process of writing a PROS program.

## Topical Tutorials

If you want more information about using a particular part of the \ref api, the **Topical Tutorials** offer longer examples
and more detail about using the PROS API.
