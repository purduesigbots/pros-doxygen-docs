\page debugging Debugging

\warning
This content is subject to change as the PROS CLI for V5 is created.

The [PROS API](../../api/index.html) provides functions like
[printf](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) that allow
your robot to output information to a connected serial console during
operation.

## Viewing printf output

To view a robot's output, there are two officially supported methods:

1.  Through the PROS CLI:

    Running `prosv5 terminal` on the command line will open an output
    stream from a robot connected over direct USB connection, VEXnet, or
    @ref jinx.

2.  From within Atom:

    Click the button labeled "Open cortex serial output"

A terminal panel will open at the bottom of the screen containing the
output of a connected robot.

## Further debug info with `errno`

`errno` is a global value that is set when any part of the PROS kernel
encounters an error. The value of `errno` is specific to each function,
so check the function headers or the [API docs](../../api/index.html)
for possible values and their meaning. If you think you're encountering
an error in the kernel code, check the value of `errno` to see what's
causing the issue.

Debugging in this manner is standard to other environments besides PROS.
For further information on using `errno`, see the following tutorial:
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_error_handling.htm>

## JINX Graphical Debugger

JINX offers further debugging functionality over traditional debugging
through print statements. For a full explanation of JINX's abilities and
its use, see @ref jinx.
