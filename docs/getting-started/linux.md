Installing on Linux
===================

Installing the toolchain
------------------------

The steps for installing the toolchain can differ greatly per
distribution. The first step is to check whether your package manager
offers the arm-none-eabi toolchain. If so, make sure that the version
available is greater than or equal to 7.2 before installing.

If you're not sure whether your distribution's package manager has the
toolchain available, or if you prefer to install things manually, follow
the instructions below.

> **note**
>
> For users of Debian-based distributions, be aware that the toolchain
> available through Apt is out of date and likely will not work for PROS
> projects. For Ubuntu users, you may see references online to a PPA by
> team-gcc-arm-embedded, but that PPA does not seem to be updated any
> more. Therefore, if you are using a Debian-based distribution or
> Ubuntu, please follow the instructions below.

1.  Download the latest version of the toolchain from [the Arm developer
    site](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
    We recommend the "Linux 64-bit" release. If you can't use this for
    some reason (e.g. you have a 32-bit system), you may need to
    download the "Source Invariant" release and build manually,
    following the instructions in the archive.
2.  Move the file to your home directory and untar it using the command
    tar -xjvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-X-20XX-qX-update-linux.tar.bz2:. The Xs
    should be replaced with those present in the name of the file you
    downloaded.
3.  Add this line to your .bashrc file (if using bash), replacing
    \<your user\> with your username:
    export PATH=\$PATH:/home/\<your user\>/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update/bin/.
    If you are using a shell other than bash, refer to that shell's
    documentation for how and where to add entries to your PATH when
    logging in.
4.  Close and re-open your terminal, or run source \~/.bashrc (if
    running bash).
5.  Test by running arm-none-eabi-gcc --version. The output should
    confirm that the version is greater than or equal to 7.2. If it is
    not, make sure you don't have conflicting versions installed through
    a package manager.

> **note**
>
> After installing the toolchain using the instructions listed above,
> upgrading to a newer version is as simple as removing the previous
> install and following the instructions again with the newer version.

Installing the CLI
------------------

1.  If you do not already have one installed, install a version of
    Python greater than or equal to 3.6
2.  Check the latest version of the PROS CLI on [our releases
    page](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest),
    and run
    python3.6 -m pip install --user https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli/releases/download/3.X.X/pros\_cli\_v5-3.X.X-py3-none-any.whl,
    replacing the number after 'python' with the version you installed
    and the Xs with the numbers you found before. If you wish to install
    for all users, run the command with sudo and remove the --user flag.
3.  Run prosv5 --version to verify the CLI was installed correctly. If
    the command doesn't work, try restarting your machine.

Installing the Editor
---------------------

> **note**
>
> The following instructions are for installing Atom and cquery. If you
> intend to use an editor other than Atom, this section is optional.

1.  Follow the instructions
    [here](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery)
    to build and install cquery.
2.  [Install Atom](https://atom.io).
3.  Run apm install pros-bootstrapper@0.0.12.
4.  Open Atom and wait for any plugins to finish installing.
5.  Happy coding!

> **note**
>
> If Atom seems to get stuck during step 4, restart Atom every few
> minutes.
