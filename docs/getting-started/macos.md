Installing on macOS
===================

There are currently two ways to install PROS 3 on macOS. The recommended
method uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and the other method involves
installing components manually.

Recommended Method (Homebrew)
-----------------------------

The recommended method of installing PROS 3 for macOS involves using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1.  If you do not already have Homebrew installed, install it by
    following the instructions on [their site](https://brew.sh). This
    will take a while, and may prompt you to follow some additional
    instructions.
2.  Once you have Homebrew installed, run
    brew tap osx-cross/arm && brew install arm-gcc-bin to register a
    repository with Homebrew that contains the toolchain used to build
    PROS projects, and then install the toolchain.
3.  Run brew tap purduesigbots/pros to register the PROS Homebrew
    repository with Homebrew.
4.  Run brew cask install pros-editor to install the PROS Editor (the
    CLI will also be installed). This may also take a while.
5.  That's it! You can now start using PROS 3.

> **note**
>
> If you do not want to use the PROS Editor, and instead intend to use
> only the PROS CLI, substitute the command in step 3 with the
> following: brew install pros-cli.

Other Methods
-------------

If you don't want to use Homebrew to install PROS 3, you can install all
the components manually.

### Install the toolchain

1.  Download the latest version of the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for
    macOS from [their
    site](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
2.  Once you have downloaded the toolchain, double click the file to
    extract its contents.
3.  Copy the contents of the gcc-arm-none-eabi-X-20XX-qX-update folder
    (where the Xs are numbers specific to the version you downloaded) to
    another folder, for example /usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain.
4.  Now you will need to link the toolchain binaries to somewhere that
    the system will be able to find them. There are two ways to do this:
    i)  (recommended, easy to update) run
        `mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain && ln -s /usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain/bin/* /usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain`
        (replacing `/usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain` with the path to the
        folder you made in step 4 above). Finally, add
        `/usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain` to the end of your `/etc/paths`
        file.
    ii) (easier, less easy to update) simply run
        `ln -s /usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain/bin/* /usr/local/bin`.

### Install the CLI

1.  Install Python 3.6 or higher from [the Python
    website](http://python.org).
2.  Install the CLI by downloading the latest version of the Python
    Wheel file (.whl) from
    [here](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest).
    Once downloaded, run
    python3 -m pip install \~/Downloads/pros-cli-v5\_3.X.X-py3-none-any.whl
    (replacing that path with the path to which you downloaded the
    file).

### Install the Editor

> **note**
>
> this section is optional if you intend to use an editor other than the
> PROS Editor

1.  Build and install cquery by following the instructions on [their
    wiki
    page](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery).
2.  Download the pros-editor-mac.zip file from [our releases
    page](https://github.com/purduesigbots/atom/releases/latest). Once
    downloaded, double click to extract the application, then drag the
    PROS Editor.app file to your /Applications folder.

Requirements
------------

Minimum macOS version: 10.8 Minimum Python version: 3.6

Known Issues
------------

RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured
to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.

If you are using the PROS Editor, open up your init script (File \> Init
Script) and add the following two lines:

``` {.sourceCode .coffee}
process.env.LANG = 'en_US.utf-8'
process.env.LC_ALL = 'en_US.utf-8'
```

If you are just using the CLI at the Terminal:

1.  Open up your Terminal.
2.  Run cd to make sure you're in your home directory.
3.  Run touch .bash\_profile to make sure you have a shell login
    configuration file.
4.  Edit the \~/.bash\_profile file in your preferred editor (you can
    also run open -e .bash\_profile to edit it in TextEdit), adding the
    following two lines at the end:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
export LANG="en_US.utf-8"
export LC_ALL="en_US.utf-8"
```

5.  Run . .bash\_profile to reload the file for the current session.

/bin/sh: intercept-c++: command not found

> **note**
>
> This issue should be fixed for PROS CLI versions \> 3.1.2

1.  Check your PROS CLI version by running prosv5 --version. If your
    version is \<= 3.1.2, try updating first to check if that solves
    your problem. If not, continue with step 2.
2.  Follow steps 1-4 listed above for those using the CLI only. In step
    4, however, add the following line instead (replacing the Xs with
    the numbers found in step 1):

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/pros-cli/3.X.X/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```
