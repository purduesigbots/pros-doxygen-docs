The most important characteristic of P\+R\+OS to note when getting started is that P\+R\+OS is just standard C or C++ programming. Anything that works in standard C/\+C++ will work as a part of a P\+R\+OS project, and similarly the errors given for code that doesn\textquotesingle{}t work will match errors given for any similar C/\+C++ code. Learning C/\+C++ is essential for using P\+R\+OS.\hypertarget{new-users_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsubsection{I\textquotesingle{}ve never used P\+R\+O\+S or written C/\+C++ code before, how do I start?}\label{new-users_autotoc_md16}
If you have not used P\+R\+OS or done non-\/\+V\+EX C/\+C++ code development before, we recommend that you check out C tutorials on the following topics\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.studytonight.com/c/user-defined-functions-in-c.php}{\texttt{ Functions}}. C is a language that heavily emphasizes functions, and knowing how they work is essential to using P\+R\+OS. The \href{../api/index.html}{\texttt{ P\+R\+OS A\+PI}} is a set of functions, so any time that you want to interact with a sensor or motor, you\textquotesingle{}re using functions.
\item \href{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm}{\texttt{ Header Files}}. The P\+R\+OS template (the set of files automatically created when you start a P\+R\+OS project) contains a couple of header files, and it\textquotesingle{}s recommended that you make additional header files as you develop your code. Header files contain the declarations for functions and global variables (among other things), which is why the \href{../api/index.html}{\texttt{ P\+R\+OS A\+PI}} can be found in {\ttfamily include/pros/api.\+h}. Knowing what code should go in a header file ({\ttfamily .h}, {\ttfamily .hpp}) or a source file ({\ttfamily .c}, {\ttfamily .cpp}) can be difficult to determine at first, but it is a very useful skill to learn.
\item \href{https://www.codingunit.com/printf-format-specifiers-format-conversions-and-formatted-output}{\texttt{ printf()}}. At some point when developing P\+R\+OS code, you will likely want to get some feedback on what the value of a variable is. This is not an exact replacement for a full debugging utility by any means, but is the standard method for troubleshooting issues in most languages and can be used for viewing sensor values or your own variables\textquotesingle{} values. The output from these {\ttfamily printf()} statements can be viewed in the terminal by running {\ttfamily pros terminal}.
\item \href{../tutorials/topical/multitasking.html}{\texttt{ Tasks}}. One common mistake that new P\+R\+OS users make is forgetting to include a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacepros_1_1c_a6a62f5325d65f95436762552df547d73}{delay()}}} statement in their tasks (this includes {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8h_a1903abdb5ef0f301d660754c8315fc17}{opcontrol()}}} too), starving the processor of resources and preventing the P\+R\+OS kernel from running properly. Every infinite loop, like the one in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8h_a1903abdb5ef0f301d660754c8315fc17}{opcontrol()}}}, needs to have a delay statement. We recommend at least 2ms.
\end{DoxyItemize}

And then for additional C tutorial topics, visit \href{https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html}{\texttt{ C\+Programming.\+com}} or \href{http://www.studytonight.com/c/overview-of-c.php}{\texttt{ Study\+Tonight}}. A good video tutorial series (as opposed to the previous text-\/based tutorials) can be found on \href{https://youtu.be/nXvy5900m3M}{\texttt{ You\+Tube}}.\hypertarget{new-users_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsubsection{I know C/\+C++, now how do I use P\+R\+O\+S?}\label{new-users_autotoc_md17}
The P\+R\+OS tutorials are designed to show the application of C/\+C++ programming to a P\+R\+OS project. The \href{../tutorials/walkthrough/clawbot.html}{\texttt{ Programming the Clawbot}} tutorial is a great place to start, as it goes through every step of putting together a sample P\+R\+OS project. Once you are ready to branch out and create your own custom project, looking through the following tutorials is recommended\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{../tutorials/general/project-structure.html}{\texttt{ P\+R\+OS Project Structure}}
\item \href{../tutorials/walkthrough/uploading.html}{\texttt{ Uploading Code}}
\item \href{../tutorials/general/debugging.html}{\texttt{ Debugging}}
\item \href{./faq.html}{\texttt{ Coding F\+A\+Qs}}

And then you can find tutorials for specific subjects from \href{../tutorials/topical/adi.html}{\texttt{ the A\+DI}} to \href{../tutorials/topical/multitasking.html}{\texttt{ tasks and multithreading}} as well.

V\+EX U team Q\+U\+E\+EN has also created a series of You\+Tube videos about C++, object-\/oriented programming, and other relevant programming topics in the context of V\+EX robots; you can find it \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxt0dHFRDpQhy24IL1wAniVq3xf8N7QAV}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{new-users_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsubsection{How do I share my code with other people?}\label{new-users_autotoc_md18}
In order to track changes to your code, as well as to help share your code with other people, you can use a version control system like Git in conjunction with a service like \href{https://github.com}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}}. If you want to share smaller parts of your code with other people in order to get help (e.\+g. through the software channel on Discord), you can use something like \href{https://gist.github.com}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Gists}} or \href{https://pastebin.com}{\texttt{ Pastebin}}.

For more information on how to use Git, including the Git C\+LI tools and setting up a respository on Git\+Hub, check out the \href{https://help.github.com}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub help pages}}. \hypertarget{install-windows}{}\doxysection{Installing on Windows}\label{install-windows}
To start using P\+R\+OS 3 on Windows, simply download the latest version of the installer (.exe file) from \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest/}{\texttt{ here}}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Make sure that you download the correct version of the installer for your computer (32-\/ or 64-\/bit). You will run into problems if you use the wrong one. 
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{install-macos}{}\doxysection{Installing on mac\+OS}\label{install-macos}
There are currently two ways to install P\+R\+OS 3 on mac\+OS. The recommended method uses \href{https://brew.sh/}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}, and the other method involves installing components manually.\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Recommended Method (\+Homebrew)}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md9}
The recommended method of installing P\+R\+OS 3 for mac\+OS involves using \href{https://brew.sh/}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If you do not already have Homebrew installed, install it by following the instructions on \href{https://brew.sh}{\texttt{ their site}}. This will take a while, and may prompt you to follow some additional instructions.
\item Once you have Homebrew installed, run {\ttfamily brew tap osx-\/cross/arm \&\& brew install arm-\/gcc-\/bin} to register a repository with Homebrew that contains the toolchain used to build P\+R\+OS projects, and then install the toolchain.
\item Run {\ttfamily brew tap purduesigbots/pros} to register the P\+R\+OS Homebrew repository with Homebrew.
\item Run {\ttfamily brew cask install pros-\/editor} to install the P\+R\+OS Editor (the C\+LI will also be installed). This may also take a while.
\item That\textquotesingle{}s it! You can now start using P\+R\+OS 3.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If you do not want to use the P\+R\+OS Editor, and instead intend to use only the P\+R\+OS C\+LI, substitute the command in step 3 with the following\+: {\ttfamily brew install pros-\/cli}.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{Other Methods}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md10}
If you don\textquotesingle{}t want to use Homebrew to install P\+R\+OS 3, you can install all the components manually.\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md11}{}\doxyparagraph{Install the toolchain}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download the latest version of the G\+NU Arm Embedded Toolchain for mac\+OS from \href{https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads}{\texttt{ their site}}.
\item Once you have downloaded the toolchain, double click the file to extract its contents.
\item Copy the contents of the {\ttfamily gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/\+X-\/20\+X\+X-\/q\+X-\/update} folder (where the Xs are numbers specific to the version you downloaded) to another folder, for example {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain}.
\item Now you will need to link the toolchain binaries to somewhere that the system will be able to find them. There are two ways to do this\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item recommended, easy to update\+: run {\ttfamily mkdir -\/p /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain \&\& ln -\/s /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain/bin/$\ast$ /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain} replacing {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain} with the path to the folder you made in step 4 above. Finally, add {\ttfamily /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain} to the end of your {\ttfamily /etc/paths} file.
\item easier, less easy to update\+: simply run {\ttfamily ln -\/s /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain/bin/$\ast$ /usr/local/bin}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md12}{}\doxyparagraph{Install the C\+LI}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md12}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install Python 3.\+6 or higher from \href{http://python.org}{\texttt{ the Python website}}.
\item Install the C\+LI by downloading the latest version of the Python Wheel file (.whl) from \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest}{\texttt{ here}}. Once downloaded, run {\ttfamily python3 -\/m pip install $\sim$/\+Downloads/pros-\/cli-\/v5\+\_\+3.X.\+X-\/py3-\/none-\/any.\+whl} (replacing that path with the path to which you downloaded the file).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md13}{}\doxyparagraph{Install the Editor}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md13}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This section is optional if you intend to use an editor other than the P\+R\+OS Editor
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Build and install cquery by following the instructions on \href{https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery}{\texttt{ their wiki page}}.
\item Download the pros-\/editor-\/mac.\+zip file from \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/atom/releases/latest}{\texttt{ our releases page}}. Once downloaded, double click to extract the application, then drag the {\ttfamily P\+R\+OS Editor.\+app} file to your {\ttfamily /\+Applications} folder.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{install-macos_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{Requirements}\label{install-macos_autotoc_md14}

{\ttfamily Runtime\+Error\+: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use A\+S\+C\+II as encoding for the environment.}

If you are using the P\+R\+OS Editor, open up your init script (File $>$ Init Script) and add the following two lines\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{process.env.LANG = 'en\_US.utf-\/8'}
\DoxyCodeLine{process.env.LC\_ALL = 'en\_US.utf-\/8'}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you are just using the C\+LI at the Terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open up your Terminal.
\item Run {\ttfamily cd} to make sure you\textquotesingle{}re in your home directory.
\item Run {\ttfamily touch .bash\+\_\+profile} to make sure you have a shell login configuration file.
\item Edit the {\ttfamily $\sim$/.bash\+\_\+profile} file in your preferred editor (you can also run {\ttfamily open -\/e .bash\+\_\+profile} to edit it in Text\+Edit), adding the following two lines at the end\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export LANG="en\_US.utf-\/8"}
\DoxyCodeLine{export LC\_ALL="en\_US.utf-\/8"}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily . .bash\+\_\+profile} to reload the file for the current session.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This issue should be fixed for P\+R\+OS C\+LI versions $>$ 3.\+1.\+2
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Check your P\+R\+OS C\+LI version by running {\ttfamily prosv5 -\/-\/version}. If your version is $<$= 3.\+1.\+2, try updating first to check if that solves your problem. If not, continue with step 2.
\item Follow steps 1-\/4 listed above for those using the C\+LI only. In step 4, however, add the following line instead (replacing the Xs with the numbers found in step 1)\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/pros-\/cli/3.X.X/libexec/bin:\$PATH"}

 \hypertarget{install-linux}{}\doxysection{Installing on Linux}\label{install-linux}
\hypertarget{install-linux_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing the toolchain}\label{install-linux_autotoc_md6}
The steps for installing the toolchain can differ greatly per distribution. The first step is to check whether your package manager offers the arm-\/none-\/eabi toolchain. If so, make sure that the version available is greater than or equal to 7.\+2 before installing.

If you\textquotesingle{}re not sure whether your distribution\textquotesingle{}s package manager has the toolchain available, or if you prefer to install things manually, follow the instructions below.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
For users of Debian-\/based distributions, be aware that the toolchain available through Apt is out of date and likely will not work for P\+R\+OS projects. For Ubuntu users, you may see references online to a P\+PA by team-\/gcc-\/arm-\/embedded, but that P\+PA does not seem to be updated any more. Therefore, if you are using a Debian-\/based distribution or Ubuntu, please follow the instructions below.
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download the latest version of the toolchain from \href{https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads}{\texttt{ the Arm developer site}}. We recommend the \char`\"{}\+Linux 64-\/bit\char`\"{} release. If you can\textquotesingle{}t use this for some reason (e.\+g. you have a 32-\/bit system), you may need to download the \char`\"{}\+Source Invariant\char`\"{} release and build manually, following the instructions in the archive.
\item Move the file to your home directory and untar it using the command {\ttfamily tar -\/xjvf gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/\+X-\/20\+X\+X-\/q\+X-\/update-\/linux.\+tar.\+bz2}. The Xs should be replaced with those present in the name of the file you downloaded.
\item Add this line to your {\ttfamily .bashrc} file (if using bash), replacing {\ttfamily $<$your user$>$} with your username\+: {\ttfamily export P\+A\+TH=\$\+P\+A\+TH\+:/home/$<$your user$>$/gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/8-\/2019-\/q3-\/update/bin/}. If you are using a shell other than bash, refer to that shell\textquotesingle{}s documentation for how and where to add entries to your P\+A\+TH when logging in.
\item Close and re-\/open your terminal, or run {\ttfamily source $\sim$/.bashrc} (if running bash).
\item Test by running {\ttfamily arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc -\/-\/version}. The output should confirm that the version is greater than or equal to 7.\+2. If it is not, make sure you don\textquotesingle{}t have conflicting versions installed through a package manager.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
After installing the toolchain using the instructions listed above, upgrading to a newer version is as simple as removing the previous install and following the instructions again with the newer version.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{install-linux_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing the C\+LI}\label{install-linux_autotoc_md7}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If you do not already have one installed, install a version of Python greater than or equal to 3.\+6
\item Check the latest version of the P\+R\+OS C\+LI on \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest}{\texttt{ our releases page}}, and run {\ttfamily python3.\+6 -\/m pip install -\/-\/user \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli/releases/download/3.X.X/pros}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/purduesigbots/pros-\/cli/releases/download/3.\+X.\+X/pros}}\textbackslash{}\+\_\+cli\textbackslash{}\+\_\+v5-\/3.\+X.\+X-\/py3-\/none-\/any.\+whl}, replacing the number after \textquotesingle{}python\textquotesingle{} with the version you installed and the Xs with the numbers you found before. If you wish to install for all users, run the command with {\ttfamily sudo} and remove the {\ttfamily -\/-\/user} flag.
\item Run {\ttfamily prosv5 -\/-\/version} to verify the C\+LI was installed correctly. If the command doesn\textquotesingle{}t work, try restarting your machine.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{install-linux_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing the Editor}\label{install-linux_autotoc_md8}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The following instructions are for installing Atom and cquery. If you intend to use an editor other than Atom, this section is optional.
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Follow the instructions \href{https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery}{\texttt{ here}} to build and install cquery.
\item \href{https://atom.io}{\texttt{ Install Atom}}.
\item Run {\ttfamily apm install pros-\/bootstrapper@0.\+0.\+12}.
\item Open Atom and wait for any plugins to finish installing.
\item Happy coding!
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If Atom seems to get stuck during step 4, restart Atom every few minutes. 
\end{DoxyNote}
