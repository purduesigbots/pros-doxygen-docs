For a full list of functions for interacting with the L\+L\+E\+MU, see its \+: \href{../../api/c/llemu.html}{\texttt{ C A\+PI}} and \href{../../api/cpp/llemu.html}{\texttt{ C++ A\+PI}}. \end{quote}

Initialization of the L\+L\+E\+MU is very simple, it\textquotesingle{}s just a call to its initialization function at whatever point in the program you would like the L\+L\+E\+MU to start displaying (this will most likely be in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8h_a9efe22aaead3a5e936b5df459de02eba}{initialize()}}}).

Initialization is done as such\+:\hypertarget{md_docs_tutorials_topical_llemu_autotoc_md61}{}\doxysection{Writing to the L\+L\+E\+MU}\label{md_docs_tutorials_topical_llemu_autotoc_md61}
Writing to the L\+L\+E\+MU is nearly identical to writing to the L\+CD with \href{../../cortex/tutorials/lcd.html}{\texttt{ P\+R\+OS 2}}. Most writing should be done with the print function, which is analogous to \href{http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/}{\texttt{ printf}}.\hypertarget{md_docs_tutorials_topical_llemu_autotoc_md62}{}\doxysection{Using the Buttons}\label{md_docs_tutorials_topical_llemu_autotoc_md62}
Using the buttons can be done in a similar method to \href{../../../cortex/tutorials/lcd.html}{\texttt{ P\+R\+OS 2}} with the \href{../../api/cpp/llemu.html\#read-buttons}{\texttt{ pros\+::lcd\+::read\+\_\+buttons}} function. See the above example for printing the button readings.

While this is sufficient for most applications, some tasks are easier to perform using the \href{../../api/cpp/llemu.html\#register-btn0-cb}{\texttt{ pros\+::lcd\+::register\+\_\+btn\#\+\_\+cb}} functions (where \# is replaced with 0, 1, or 2 for the left, center, and right buttons respectively). With these function you can assign a function to be called each time that the button is pressed.
