There are currently two ways to install P\+R\+OS 3 on mac\+OS.

The recommended method of installing P\+R\+OS 3 for mac\+OS involves using \href{https://brew.sh/}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If you do not already have Homebrew installed, install it by following the instructions on \href{https://brew.sh}{\texttt{ their site}}. This will take a while, and may prompt you to follow some additional instructions.
\item Once you have Homebrew installed, run {\ttfamily brew tap osx-\/cross/arm \&\& brew install arm-\/gcc-\/bin} to register a repository with Homebrew that contains the toolchain used to build P\+R\+OS projects, and then install the toolchain.
\item Run {\ttfamily brew tap purduesigbots/pros} to register the P\+R\+OS Homebrew repository with Homebrew.
\item Run {\ttfamily brew cask install pros-\/editor} to install the P\+R\+OS Editor (the C\+LI will also be installed). This may also take a while.
\item That\textquotesingle{}s it! You can now start using P\+R\+OS 3.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If you do not want to use the P\+R\+OS Editor, and instead intend to use only the P\+R\+OS C\+LI, substitute the command in step 3 with the following\+: {\ttfamily brew install pros-\/cli}.
\end{DoxyNote}

If you don\textquotesingle{}t want to use Homebrew to install P\+R\+OS 3, you can install all the components manually.\hypertarget{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Install the toolchain}\label{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md12}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download the latest version of the G\+NU Arm Embedded Toolchain for mac\+OS from \href{https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads}{\texttt{ their site}}.
\item Once you have downloaded the toolchain, double click the file to extract its contents.
\item Copy the contents of the {\ttfamily gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/\+X-\/20\+X\+X-\/q\+X-\/update} folder (where the Xs are numbers specific to the version you downloaded) to another folder, for example {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain}.
\item Now you will need to link the toolchain binaries to somewhere that the system will be able to find them. There are two ways to do this\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item recommended, easy to update\+: run {\ttfamily mkdir -\/p /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain \&\& ln -\/s /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain/bin/$\ast$ /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain} replacing {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain} with the path to the folder you made in step 4 above. Finally, add {\ttfamily /usr/local/bin/pros-\/toolchain} to the end of your {\ttfamily /etc/paths} file.
\item easier, less easy to update\+: simply run {\ttfamily ln -\/s /usr/local/lib/pros-\/toolchain/bin/$\ast$ /usr/local/bin}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{Install the C\+LI}\label{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md13}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install Python 3.\+6 or higher from \href{http://python.org}{\texttt{ the Python website}}.
\item Install the C\+LI by downloading the latest version of the Python Wheel file (.whl) from \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest}{\texttt{ here}}. Once downloaded, run {\ttfamily python3 -\/m pip install $\sim$/\+Downloads/pros-\/cli-\/v5\+\_\+3.X.\+X-\/py3-\/none-\/any.\+whl} (replacing that path with the path to which you downloaded the file).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{Install the Editor}\label{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md14}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This section is optional if you intend to use an editor other than the P\+R\+OS Editor
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Build and install cquery by following the instructions on \href{https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery}{\texttt{ their wiki page}}.
\item Download the pros-\/editor-\/mac.\+zip file from \href{https://github.com/purduesigbots/atom/releases/latest}{\texttt{ our releases page}}. Once downloaded, double click to extract the application, then drag the {\ttfamily P\+R\+OS Editor.\+app} file to your {\ttfamily /\+Applications} folder.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md15}
Minimum mac\+OS version\+: 10.\+8 Minimum Python version\+: 3.\+6\hypertarget{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysection{Known Issues}\label{md_docs_getting-started_macos_autotoc_md16}
{\ttfamily Runtime\+Error\+: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use A\+S\+C\+II as encoding for the environment.}

If you are using the P\+R\+OS Editor, open up your init script (File $>$ Init Script) and add the following two lines\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{process.env.LANG = 'en\_US.utf-\/8'}
\DoxyCodeLine{process.env.LC\_ALL = 'en\_US.utf-\/8'}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you are just using the C\+LI at the Terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open up your Terminal.
\item Run {\ttfamily cd} to make sure you\textquotesingle{}re in your home directory.
\item Run {\ttfamily touch .bash\+\_\+profile} to make sure you have a shell login configuration file.
\item Edit the {\ttfamily $\sim$/.bash\+\_\+profile} file in your preferred editor (you can also run {\ttfamily open -\/e .bash\+\_\+profile} to edit it in Text\+Edit), adding the following two lines at the end\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export LANG="en\_US.utf-\/8"}
\DoxyCodeLine{export LC\_ALL="en\_US.utf-\/8"}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily . .bash\+\_\+profile} to reload the file for the current session.
\end{DoxyItemize}

 {\ttfamily /bin/sh\+: intercept-\/c++\+: command not found}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This issue should be fixed for P\+R\+OS C\+LI versions $>$ 3.\+1.\+2
\end{DoxyNote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Check your P\+R\+OS C\+LI version by running prosv5 --version. If your version is $<$= 3.\+1.\+2, try updating first to check if that solves your problem. If not, continue with step 2.
\item Follow steps 1-\/4 listed above for those using the C\+LI only. In step 4, however, add the following line instead (replacing the Xs with the numbers found in step 1)\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/pros-\/cli/3.X.X/libexec/bin:\$PATH"}
