For a full list of functions for interacting with the V5 Controller, see its \+: \href{../../api/c/misc.html}{\tt C A\+PI} and \href{../../api/cpp/misc.html}{\tt C++ A\+PI}.

Feedback from the V5 Controller comes in two forms -\/ analog and digital. The analog data comes from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick}{\tt joysticks}, and the digital data comes from the buttons. \end{quote}


The analog data is a value in the range of \mbox{[}-\/127,127\mbox{]}, and digital data is either 1 or 0 (pressed or unpressed, respectively).

Retrieve analog values from the V5 Controller in the following manner\+:

The controller returns a range of \mbox{[}-\/127,127\mbox{]} for analog data, which is why the \href{../../api/c/motors.html#motor-move}{\tt motor\+\_\+move} function is appropriate for easy use with the controllers.

Retrieve Digital Values from the V5 Controller in the following manner\+:
