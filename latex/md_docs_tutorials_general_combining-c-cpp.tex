The P\+R\+OS C and C++ A\+P\+Is cover the exact same feature set, which means that there is no significant advantage to using functions from one A\+PI in another language. However, if you do find yourself wanting to use C A\+PI functions in C++, these functions are accessible through the namespace {\ttfamily pros\+::c}.

This can also be done by using the {\ttfamily pros\+::c} namespace as such\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}using namespace pros::c;
\end{DoxyVerb}


As always, bear in mind the dangers of setting a global namespace and only use the {\ttfamily using} keyword in appropriate scopes.
