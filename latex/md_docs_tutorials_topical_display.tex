Interacting with the touchscreen on the V5 Brain is made possible through \href{https://littlevgl.com}{\texttt{ L\+V\+GL}}. L\+V\+GL is a full-\/featured C graphics library (it\textquotesingle{}s accessible in C++ projects too under the same A\+PI).

The first step to getting started with L\+V\+GL is to include {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{apix_8h}{pros/apix.\+h}}} in your {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8h}{main.\+h}}} file or other header files. This includes the full L\+V\+GL feature set as described in their documentation\+: \href{https://littlevgl.com/}{\texttt{ https\+://littlevgl.\+com/}}

You can follow along with any of the L\+V\+GL \href{https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples/tree/master/lv_tutorial}{\texttt{ tutorials}} or \href{https://docs.littlevgl.com/\#Objects}{\texttt{ wiki}}. There is no need to port or initialize L\+V\+GL, you can simply start creating objects.

Custom L\+V\+GL code cannot be displayed at the same time as the \href{./llemu.html}{\texttt{ L\+L\+E\+MU}}. \+: As a result, you must remove the L\+L\+E\+MU code ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacepros_1_1lcd}{pros\+::lcd}}}) that is present in {\ttfamily initialize.\+cpp} by default in a new project. \end{quote}
