For a full list of functions for interacting with Tasks, see its \+: \href{../../api/c/rtos.html}{\tt C A\+PI} and \href{../../api/cpp/rtos.html}{\tt C++ A\+PI}.

Task notifications are a powerful new feature in P\+R\+OS 3 which allows direct-\/to-\/task synchronization. Each task has a 32-\/bit notification value. Each task can block on its own notification (wait for it to become non-\/zero) and any task can update the notification value.

The simplest application of task notifications does not care about the task notification value\+:
