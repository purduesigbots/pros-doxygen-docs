You can interact with files on the micro\+SD card (you can {\bfseries{not}} interact with files on the V5 brain\textquotesingle{}s flash) through standard C/\+C++ file I/O methods. For the most part, you can follow along with any standard C tutorial for file I/O and it will work with P\+R\+OS. Here are a couple of recommended tutorials\+:

The only additional detail needed for interacting with the filesystem in P\+R\+OS is that any files on the micro\+SD card {\bfseries{must}} be prefaced with {\ttfamily /usd/}. A file on the micro\+SD card can be written to in the following manner\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FILE* usd\_file\_write = fopen(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"/usd/example.txt"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"w"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{fputs(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"Example text"}, usd\_file\_write);}
\DoxyCodeLine{fclose(usd\_file\_write);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{FILE* usd\_file\_read = fopen(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"/usd/example.txt"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"r"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{char} buf[50]; \textcolor{comment}{// This just needs to be larger than the contents of the file}}
\DoxyCodeLine{fread(buf, 1, 50, usd\_file\_read); \textcolor{comment}{// passing 1 because a `char` is 1 byte, and 50 b/c it's the length of buf}}
\DoxyCodeLine{printf(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"\%s\(\backslash\)n"}, buf); \textcolor{comment}{// print the string read from the file}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Should print "Example text" to the terminal}}
\DoxyCodeLine{fclose(usd\_file\_read); \textcolor{comment}{// always close files when you're done with them}}
\end{DoxyCode}

The micro\+SD card must be fat32 in order to work.\hypertarget{md_docs_tutorials_topical_filesystem_autotoc_md46}{}\doxysubsection{Serial}\label{md_docs_tutorials_topical_filesystem_autotoc_md46}
It\textquotesingle{}s also possible to interact with the serial communications ({\ttfamily stdin}, {\ttfamily stdout}, etc.) through the filesystem drivers. You can write and read from these streams in the same manner as a file, but using the four character stream identifiers.

For instance, you can write to {\ttfamily stderr} in the following manner\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FILE* stderr = fopen(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"serr"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"w"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{fputs(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"Example text"}, stderr);}
\DoxyCodeLine{fclose(usd\_file\_write);}
\end{DoxyCode}


There are also a number of methods for controlling serial communication behavior exposed in \href{../../extended/apix.html}{\texttt{ apix.\+h}}. These methods can be accessed through the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{apix_8h_a962daefd6f45a8def6ff00802a23fbff}{serctl()}}} function. At the moment two actions are supported -\/activating/deactivating the streams, and enabling/disabling \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing}{\texttt{ C\+O\+BS}} . If you want to read the serial comms yourself (without using {\ttfamily pros terminal}), then you\textquotesingle{}ll want to disable C\+O\+BS.
